# RobotSoccer
This repo contains code for generating .dll for playing Robot Soccer with 5-players-teams for 'Simurosot' simulator.

For running it, it is necesary to download Microsoft Visual c++ 6 and the code on this repo. For this last, you can execute on a terminal:
- git clone https://github.com/Sebasorf/RobotSoccer.git
or download it as .zip file.

In RobotSoccer folder, you can open Strategy.dsw by right-clicking on it and choosing Microsoft Visual c++ 6. This will only work on Windows SO.

You must compile Strategy.cpp and build 'Basico.dll'.

Then you can play by copying this .dll into SoccerSimulator install directory and opening it as c++ script.
