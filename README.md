# RobotSoccer
This repo contains code for generating .dll for playing Robot Soccer with 5-players-teams for 'Simurosot' simulator.

For running it, it is necesary to download Microsoft Visual c++ 6 and the code on this repo. For this last, you can execute on a terminal:
- git clone https://github.com/Sebasorf/RobotSoccer.git
or download it as .zip file.

In this Project, you can find two folders. One of them is the code for generating Strategy.dll for yellow team, and the other one contains code for generating Strategy.dll for blue team. 

In one RobotSoccer-coloured-team folder, you can open Strategy.dsw by right-clicking on it and choosing Microsoft Visual c++ 6. This will only work on Windows SO. You should build the .dll (it will be saved in project), and then put it in the Strategy folder of the team you want to use it. It's usually on C://Strategy folder.

Finally, you must open it as c++ script in Simurosot Simulator.
